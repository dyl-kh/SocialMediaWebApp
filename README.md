# Social Media Web App

This is a social media web application built using React, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Sequelize ORM and a MySql Database. This was developed for a University project with my partner Thomas. We achieved full marks for this submission.

## Before you go any further
Please not the project is using a database that is not as performant as the previous one used supplied by our university. Therefore this has lead to some issues with the application, mainly slow loading times. I apologise for this and hope you can still enjoy the application.
